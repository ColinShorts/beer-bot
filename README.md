# beer-bot

Reminder to celebrate a (possibly) long day with a beer üç∫.

## Description

A Slack Bot to announce it is time to enjoy a beer/< insert alcohol of choice>/< insert non-alcoholic beverage of
choice>.

## Build

Nice and straight forward:

```shell
cargo build --release
```

Resulting in the binary `./target/release/beer-bot`.

### Logging

By default, beer-bot uses `stdout` for its logging, but this can be changed to `syslog` by enabling the build
feature `syslog`:

```shell
cargo build --release features syslog
```

### Docker

First create a config file called `config.toml`.
See [Options](#options).

```shell
docker compose up
```

Build beer-bot, create a minimal image with beer-bot and run the image.

## Usage

Nice and straight forward:

```shell
beer-bot
```

beer-bot is configured by combining a config file and environment variables, where environment variables take precedence
over the config file.
All the options need to be specified.

### Options

| Key        | Meaning                                                              |
|------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------|
| token      | Slack bot oAuth token - Requires `chat:write` scope                  |
| crons      | List of cron expressions with a seconds column prepended.            |
| channel_id | Either the channel name without the `#` or the ID in channel details |
| messages   | List of messages to randomly pick from for announcements             |

### Environment Variables

Environment variables are the same as the config file keys, but in `SCREAMING_SNAKE_CASE` and prefixed with `BEERBOT_`.
Lists like `messages` are seperated by `¬¨`. (Needed a symbol that isn't likely to be in the messages).

#### Examples

```shell
BEERBOT_TOKEN="xo..."
BEERBOT_CHANNEL_ID="beer-bot"
BEERBOT_MESSAGES="Lets Go¬¨Its time to party"
```

### Config File

| Platform | Location                                                                         |
|----------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Linux    | `$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/beerbot/beer-bot.toml` or `$HOME/.config/beerbot/beerbot.toml` |
| macOS    | `$HOME/Library/Application Support/com.beerbot.beerbot/beerbot.toml`             |
| Windows  | `{FOLDERID_LocalAppData}\\com\\beerbot\\beerbot\\config\\beerbot.toml`           |

#### Example

```toml
token = "xo..."
crons = ["0 0 17 * * mon-fri *"]
channel_id = "beer-bot"
messages = ["It's that time again"]
```
