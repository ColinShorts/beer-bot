# beer-bot

Reminder to celebrate a (possibly) long day with a beer üç∫.

## Description
A Slack Bot to announce it is time to enjoy a beer/< insert alcohol of choice>/< insert non-alcoholic beverage of choice>.

## Build

Nice and straight forward:
```shell
cargo build --release
```
Resulting in the binary `./target/release/beer-bot`.


### Features

| Feature  | Quick Explanation                       | Enabled by Default |
|----------|-----------------------------------------|--------------------|
| syslog   | Output to syslog                        | ‚òê                  |
| commands | Enable slash commands using Socket Mode | ‚òë                  |

Features are additive.
So to have Beer Bot output to Syslog and not enable slash commands, all default features must first be disabled:

```shell
cargo build --release --no-default-features --features "syslog"
```

#### Syslog Feature

By default, Beer Bot output to stdout, but this can be changed to utilise syslog.
The logging levels are mapped to syslog severities according to the following table:

| Log Level | Syslog Severity |
|-----------|-----------------|
| ERROR     | Error           |
| WARN      | Warning         |
| INFO      | Notice          |
| DEBUG     | Info            |
| TRACE     | Debug           |

### Docker
First create a config file called `config.toml`.
See [Options](#options).

```shell
docker compose up
```
Build beer-bot, create a minimal image with beer-bot and run the image.
This file is included in the `docker-compose.yml` as a secret.

## Usage

Nice and straight forward:
```shell
beer-bot
```

beer-bot is configured by combining a config file and environment variables, where environment variables take precedence over the config file.
All the options need to be specified.

### Options
| Key          | Meaning                                                              |
| ------------ | -------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| token        | Slack bot oAuth token - Requires `chat:write` scope                  |
| secret_token | Slack SocketMode token - Only required if `commands` feature enabled |
| crons        | List of cron expressions with a seconds column prepended.            |
| channel_id   | Either the channel name without the `#` or the ID in channel details |
| messages     | List of messages to randomly pick from for announcements             |

### Environment Variables

Environment variables are the same as the config file keys, but in `SCREAMING_SNAKE_CASE` and prefixed with `BEERBOT_`.
Lists like `messages` are seperated by `¬¨`. (Needed a symbol that isn't likely to be in the messages).

#### Examples
```shell
BEERBOT_TOKEN="xo..."
BEERBOT_CHANNEL_ID="beer-bot"
BEERBOT_MESSAGES="Lets Go¬¨Its time to party"
```
